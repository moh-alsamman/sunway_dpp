This course largely deals with the C++ language.

As one of the Week 1 readings will explain, you can download the source code for the examples seen in the lecture videos. Please see the appropriate reading under Week 1 for the details.

While this course doesn't have an official textbook, there are some external references you might find useful. These websites have searchable documentation for most of the C++ language and standard library:

https://en.cppreference.com/w/

(If you browse the above references, keep in mind that the specific version of C++ covered in the lectures is C++14.)

If you would like a different perspective in writing, there is a sequence of beginner tutorials to the C++ language here:
